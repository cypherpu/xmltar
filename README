xmltar is intended to be a general purpose archive program. It
creates archives in an (optionally compressed) xml format. It is
currently targeted towards linux systems with ext[2,3,4]
filesystems.

This is to be considered pre-alpha software. The current version
can be used for generating backups, however it's true purpose is
to serve as a test-bed for future versions.

xmltar has several advantages compared to tar:

1. Archives are created in a simple, extensible xml format. As a
consequence, the structure of the archives can be easily
investigated, and one can easily verify that no unwanted or private
information is included in the archive.

2. Multivolume archive processing is much enhanced. It is possible
to compress multivolume archives. It is possible to append to
multivolume archives.

The current version of xmltar has some disadvantages:

1. It is much slower than tar.

2. Only regular files, symbolic links, and directories are
supported in the current version.
